            Led by the <strong>Université de Montpellier</strong> with key
            partners <strong>BionomeeX</strong> and <strong>Numalis</strong>,
            the project combines academic rigor, industrial validation, and
            AI-assisted content generation to build a standardized benchmark for
            AI literacy and technical skills.

          <h2>🎯 The Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of AICET is to design a
            <strong>trusted, standardized AI test</strong> assessing the
            competencies of engineers, researchers, and professionals working
            with artificial intelligence. The test must cover the full spectrum
            of AI knowledge — from ethics and data governance to algorithmic
            principles, coding, and model evaluation — while maintaining high
            scientific integrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            To achieve this, the consortium developed an
            <strong
              >automated question generation and validation pipeline</strong
            >
            capable of producing and filtering thousands of questions, all
            linked to a well-defined ontology and validated by domain experts
            before certification.

          <h2>💡 The AICET Pipeline Concept</h2>
          <p>
            BionomeeX was responsible for creating the
            <strong>data generation and management pipeline</strong>, the heart
            of the AICET system. The pipeline automates the generation of
            AI-related questions using
            <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> and ensures their
            consistency through a
            <strong>multi-step validation workflow</strong>.
          </p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem">
            <li>
              🧠 <strong>Question Generation:</strong> AI models generate
              candidate questions following a structured ontology.
            </li>
            <li>
              🏷️ <strong>Ontology Tagging:</strong> Each question is annotated
              with multiple tags (topic, difficulty, skill type).
            </li>
            <li>
              🔍 <strong>Automatic Filtering:</strong> Scripts parse and clean
              malformed, redundant, or ambiguous questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              👩‍🏫 <strong>Expert Review:</strong> Domain specialists validate or
              reject each question for accuracy and clarity.
            </li>
            <li>
              📦 <strong>Dataset Consolidation:</strong> Approved questions are
              sent to Numalis for integration and test design.
            </li>
          </ol>

            This approach guarantees
            <strong>diversity, balance, and pedagogical validity</strong> in the

            manual methods.

          <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem">
            <li>
              <strong>Backend:</strong> Python + FastAPI API to manage question

            The architecture was designed for
            <strong>scalability and transparency</strong>, allowing real-time
            monitoring of data flow from generation to validation and export to
            Numalis.
